Dream Big - written by Tim Mancuso 

Tell me one time what you want to see   
A new house new car new job new me   
You say big dreams don't pay the rent   
But what's left when the money's all spent 

Tell me one time what you're gonna do   
You're gonna grow old and grey and blue   
(well) maybe one day I'll be the President   
Tell me what you're gonna do then 

(you say) That'll never work   
That'll never be   
And you wonder what's wrong with me   
I say to you   
Because I still believe 

(I) Dream Big   
Dream Proud   
Dream Long   
Dream Loud   
Dream On and remember there's no room for doubt 

(I) Stand Tall   
Never Fall   
I always Remember when my back's to the wall   
You've got to Dream Big   
Or don't dream at all 

Stand back Jack take a look at your life   
You lost your job and you left your wife   
Had a little piece of the American dream   
-Thanks man but none for me 

I walk these streets like they were my own   
(and) I laugh when I think about how I've grown   
I made it this far on my own two feet   
And I'll be kickin' and screamin' to the last heartbeat 

(you say) That'll never work   
That'll never be   
And you wonder what's wrong with me   
I say to you You've got to believe 

Dream Big   
Dream Proud   
Dream Long   
Dream Loud   
Dream On and remember there's no room for doubt 

Stand Tall   
Never Fall   
Always Remember when your back's to the wall   
You've got to Dream Big   
Or don't dream at all 

I Dream Big   
I Dream Proud   
Dream Long   
Dream Loud   
Dream On and remember there's no room for doubt   
I Stand Tall   
I Never Fall   
I Always Remember when my back's to the wall 

You've got to Dream Big   
Or don't dream at all 

You've got to Dream Big   
Or don't dream at all
