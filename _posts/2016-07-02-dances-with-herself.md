Dances With Herself by Tim Mancuso 

She walks down a lover's lane   
But it's all the same   
She's been there before 

Inside of her cold blue eyes   
Lies a frozen tear   
From a thousand years ago 

It's no use to try and hide   
There's a hole inside   
That brings her 'round to face 

Alone in her lonely world   
She's the only girl   
Trying to find her place 

She lives on the telephone line   
Says she's wasting her time   
Cause she knows it can't be helped   
She sleeps in a pile of dreams   
Torn apart at the seams   
And she dances with herself 

She walks down a lover's lane   
But it's all the same   
She's been there before 

Inside of her cold blue eyes   
Lies a frozen tear   
From a thousand years ago 

She lives on the telephone line   
Says she's wasting her time   
But she knows it can't be helped   
She sleeps in a pile of dreams   
Torn apart at the seams   
And she dances with herself 

She lives on the telephone line   
Says she's wasting her time   
Cause she knows it can't be helped   
She sleeps in a pile of dreams   
Torn apart at the seams   
And she dances with herself   
And she dances with herself   
And she dances with herself
