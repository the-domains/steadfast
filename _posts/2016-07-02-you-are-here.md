Hello - please consider becoming a 'Fan' on [Facebook][0] or on [Reverbnation][1]. I appreciate it greatly. 

\* NOTE: I put up FULL songs for the player, so you can listen, download and enjoy as often as you want. :-) Blessings to you & Thanks for the 'fan', 'follow', and comments!! 

It's come up a few times that some of the older lyrics and music posted here are not really 'Christian' songs. That's quite true, in fact, I wasn't saved (by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ) during the time these were written. In fact, it was just around the time of the 'one EP' project that I had come to know Christ as my Lord and Savior. It took some time for me to grow into the place I am today. Actually, I continue to grow daily. My hope is that through these songs you will hear a longing for a purpose 'bigger than ourselves' that is encoded into each of our hearts. 

To have finally found that true truth - that is nothing short of Awesome. Praise God for Grace and Mercy. Blessings, -Tim
