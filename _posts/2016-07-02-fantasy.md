Fantasy - written by Tim Mancuso 

We were under the cover of the night   
and we were all alone 

oh girl you make me feel so right   
we ain't going home 

The pounding of our hearts   
I feel the fire start   
oh girl you make me want to stay   
and I'm gonna take you all the way 

Is this for real or is it a fantasy   
we're closer than I thought we'd ever be   
You've got a lot of love and you're giving it all to me   
Is this for real or is it a fantasy 

You know we couldn't get closer if we tried   
so why waste the time 

(I) ain't thinking about my foolish pride   
now that you are mine 

I'm burning out of control   
oh baby let it go   
I've got you in my arms to stay   
and I'm gonna take you all the way 

Is this for real or is it a fantasy   
we're closer than I thought we'd ever be   
You've got a lot of love and you're giving it all to me   
Is this for real or is it a fantasy 

Is this for real or is it a fantasy   
we're closer than I thought we'd ever be   
You've got a lot of love and you're giving it all to me   
Is this for real   
Is this for real   
Is this for real or is it a fantasy
