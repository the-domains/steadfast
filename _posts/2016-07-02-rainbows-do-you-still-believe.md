(Do You Still Believe in) Rainbows - written by Tim Mancuso 

I Hope that you smile   
I hope that you're happy now   
I heard that you're married   
You're doing alright 

I wish I could let it go today   
But it just won't go away   
Oh No, You're still right here inside 

Maybe I should call   
No that wouldn't be right   
You've got him now   
You don't need me to mess your mind 

But if I could talk with you today   
There's so much I'd want to say   
Oh Lord you know it's been a long long time 

Do you still believe in rainbows   
Do your eyes still shine in the night   
And do you still remember   
The last time that we said goodbye 

I miss you now   
I miss you always   
Nothing's the same without you in my life 

I wish I could find a better way   
Just to make it through each day   
You know you are forever on my mind 

Do you still believe in rainbows   
Does the moonlight on the water make you cry   
And do you still remember   
The last time that we   
The last time that we   
The last time that we said goodbye
