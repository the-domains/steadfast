## [Cry No More][0]

Cry No More - T. Mancuso 

She puts her head down in her hands   
Falls there on the floor 

No she don't laugh   
She don't smile   
She can hardly stand   
This getting by don't get her by anymore

And she wonders what it takes - Will she ever make it out   
And Cry No More   
Cry No More 

She needs deliverance - Love and Forgiveness   
Someone to save her 

She can't run   
She can't hide   
There's a hole down deep inside   
She wants the light 

And her stone heart starts to break   
She'll let Him in That's all it takes   
To Cry No More   
Cry No More 

As her stone heart starts to break   
She'll let Him in And that's all it takes   
To Cry No More   
Cry No More 

She lifts her head up to the sky   
Falls down on her knees 

Now she can laugh   
She can smile   
And she knows that she can stand 

He's all the strength she'll ever need   
He said come to Me And I'll set you free   
To Cry No More   
Cry No More   
Cry No More   
Cry No More...
