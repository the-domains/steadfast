Never Lose Who You Are - written by Tim Mancuso / J. Neveils 

It's just another night alone when   
The ringing of the telephone stops   
A teardrop in my eye   
Gazing at the sky 

I pick up the receiver - nothing   
But I know somewhere someone's waiting   
Raised voices in the night   
Fires burn out of sight 

Out there on the street love's dying   
Another lonely lover's trying   
To resurrect what's dead   
With feelings in their head 

They look to me 'cause I hold the answers   
Love ain't for sure you've got to just take your chances   
Not everyone can win   
And that's the way it's always been 

But in the end you will find all the answers   
To the questions in your heart   
If in this world of no second chances   
You never lose who you are   
You never lose who you are 

Life is hard when you're all alone   
You think of things that you might have known   
If luck had come your way   
And love had come to stay 

And all you're hearing is a voice inside you   
It's telling you stop - and look around you   
It's telling you to be   
What others want to see 

But in the end you will find all the answers   
To the questions in your heart   
If in this world of worn out romances   
You never lose who you are   
Never lose who you are 

I was alone and I still wonder   
Just how this world swept me under   
When all hope was lost   
I had to pay the cost 

Since then it's always been the same way   
Condemned to living from day to day   
To warn lovers like you   
- Hold on to love that's true 

'Cause in the end you will find all the answers   
To the questions in your heart   
If in this world of no second chances   
You never lose who you are   
Never Lose Who You Are   
Never Lose Who You Are   
Never Lose Who You Are
